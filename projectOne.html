              <p class="paragraph">
                Aalborg 89ers is an American football club. Their website is
                poorly structured and this makes difficult for users to navigate
                around and find the information they need. I was part of a team
                of four and we worked on organizing the content, creating a
                user-centered design to provide better user experiences.

            For our exam in the second semester, we had to find a client who has
            design problems with their website. The Local American Football team
            website had poor Information Architecture and not a sufficient way
            of presenting the information to the different user groups.

              The Aalborg’s local American Football Club has a website in which
              the information is scattered all over the website. The club wants
              to send a message that the sport is for everyone, despite gender,
              age, or skill level. As American football is not that popular
              sport in Denmark, the client wants to introduce what it is to be
              part of such a team and culture.

              For this project, we conducted seven user interviews in order to

              We conducted a Card sorting test in order to create our categories

              – open card sorting, will help us see which topics according to
              our users are connected and it will also help us to come up with
              the names for the created groups.

              Sitemaps to create a model of a website's structure and content
              presenting the navigation between the pages.

              change it to POTENTIAL INJURIES according to our testing.
              Moreover, we changed the layout on the POTENTIAL INJURIES page to
              increase the user experience by maximizing readability and
