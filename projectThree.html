                Refood is an application(prototype) that allows people to track
                their food waste and keep them informed about the problem. I was
                in a team of three and we had to work with wicked problems.
                Refood is one solution based on creating values for a group of
                users instead of functionalities.

            One of our school projects was to choose and work with an open
            problem issue(wicked problems). We had to provide a solution by
            applying a user-centered approach(Design thinking), focusing more on
            group values than functionalities.

                From our research, we gathered that our target audience is rather
                busy and we had to come up with a product that they can use in
                their daily life. We conducted several tests in order to gather
                information on what functionalities we should have that it will
                make the app applicable.

              With the Affinity diagram method, we were able to see how the

              prioritized, and what elements be displayed. After that, we used
              Sitemaps to create a model of a website's structure and content
              presenting the navigation between the pages.

              From our testing, we concluded that the tracked content was a bit stuffed with bad visibility. Also, the activity status didn't bring enough information on how can be used. Our solution was to show one tracker which shows the average food waste per capita - per week and to remove the activity status in order to increase the clarity and improve the user experince.
