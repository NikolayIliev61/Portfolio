          <p class="paragraph">
            For our exam in the first semester, we had chosen client which was
            Svalengarden Mest. They had two business models, B2B and B2C, which
            contains a very large amount of information and a large number of
            categories and subcategories. Our task was focused on the B2C part
            and create a design following the requirements of the client.

              For this project, we conducted six user interviews in order to get
              a better understanding of the problem. Fifteen to twenty minutes

              The customer product had poor Information Architecture and most of
              the information was spread out on different pages which were
              confusing for the users. Based on the user research and the
              content inventory, we improved the content by putting it all
              together instead of spreading it. Also, we changed some of the
              categories into more proper ones and added the Reviews section on
              the main page. All of this brought better user experience and
              clarity.

            <h3>Sitemaps</h3>

            <p class="paragraph">
              With the Affinity diagram method, we were able to see how the
              content will be spread out through the website, how it will be
              prioritized, and what elements be displayed. After that, we used
              Sitemaps to create a model of a website's structure and content
              presenting the navigation between the pages.

                After the analysis of the user research and the standard data,
                we decided to go with the mobile-first approach. In order to
                represent the four seasons in a visible and readable way we had
                to, create 4 squares which each of them representing a different
                season with its color. The most common layout, showing each
                section one under another wouldn't have worked for us because if
                it's summer the user had to scroll to the bottom of the website
                to find the menu while now he can just see it on the top.

              From the testing, we received that we had to create a better
              contrast in order to put more attention to the content. That's why
              we changed the white background to a darker one. Also, we make the
              seasonal menu in different colors which represents the seasons for
              a better user experience. The alignment of the titles and the text
              was changed a bit in some places to create a better balance on the
              page.
